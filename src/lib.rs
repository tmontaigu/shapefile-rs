//! Read & Write [Shapefile](http://downloads.esri.com/support/whitepapers/mo_/shapefile.pdf) in Rust
//!
//! A _shapefile_ is in reality a collection of 3 mandatory files:
//!  -  .shp (feature geometry aka shapes)
//!  -  .shx (index of feature geometry)
//!  -  .dbf (attribute information, aka records)
//!
//! As different shapefiles can store different type of shapes
//! (but one shapefile can only store the same type of shapes)
//! This library provide two ways of reading the shapes:
//!
//! 1) Reading as [Shape](record/enum.Shape.html) and then do a `match` to handle the different shapes
//! 2) Reading directly as concrete shapes (ie Polyline, PolylineZ, Point, etc) this of course only
//! works if the file actually contains shapes that matches the requested type
//!
//! # Shapefiles shapes
//!
//! The [`Point`], [`PointM`] and [`PointZ`] are the base data types of shapefiles,
//! the other shapes (`Polyline, Multipoint`, ...) are collections of these type of points
//! with different semantics (multiple parts or no, closed parts or no, ...)
//!
//! With the exception of the [`Multipatch`] shape, each shape as a variant for each type
//! of point. ([`Multipatch`] always uses [`PointZ`])
//! Eg: For the polyline, there is [`Polyline`], [`PolylineM`], [`PolylineZ`]
//!
//! # Reading
//!
//! For more details see the [reader](reader/index.html) module
//!
//! # Writing
//!
//! To write a file see the [writer](writer/index.html) module
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! The `geo-types` feature can be enabled to have access to `From` and `TryFrom`
//! implementations allowing to convert (or try to) back and forth between shapefile's type and
//! the one in `geo_types`
//!

//! [`PointM`]: record/point/struct.PointM.html

//! [`PolylineM`]: record/polyline/type.PolylineM.html
